                    The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai
                    (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first
                    British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain.
                    <br>The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style,
                    inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by
                    architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The
                    structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an
                    architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.
                    After its construction, the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for
                    important colonial personnel. The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops
                    left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle,
                    opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. Today, the monument is
                    synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is
                    also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds
                    significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with
                    the lighting of the menorah, since 2003. There are five jetties located at the Gateway, of which two
                    are used for commercial ferry operations.

            <div>
                <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar
                    Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658)
                    to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan
                    himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and
                    a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

                    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases
                    of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
                    entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be
                    approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000
                    artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the emperor’s court
                    architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and
                    divinity.

                    The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim
                    art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is
                    regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history.
                    The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a year[3] and in 2007, it was declared a winner
                    of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that
                    historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned
                    construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to
                    Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also
                    constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and
                    combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.

                    The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire
                    in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following
                    the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress
                    was subsequently used as a garrison.

                    On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above
                    the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the
                    Indian tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its
                    ramparts.

                    The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.

            <div>
                <p>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone, it is on
                    the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

                    The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai
                    Singh, the founder of the city of Jaipur, India.[1] He was so inspired by the unique structure of
                    Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.

                    It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953
                    small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.[2] The original intent of the
                    lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the
                    street below without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi
                    effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in
                    summer.[2][3][4] Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of
                    the palace, but it is the back.[5]

                    In 2006, renovation works on the Mahal were undertaken, after a gap of 50 years, to give a facelift
                    to the monument at an estimated cost of Rs 4.568 million.[6] The corporate sector lent a hand to
                    preserve the historical monuments of Jaipur and the Unit Trust of India has adopted Hawa Mahal to
                    maintain it.[7] The palace is an extended part of a huge complex. The stone-carved screens, small
                    casements, and arched roofs are some of the features of this popular tourist spot. The monument also
                    has delicately modelled hanging cornices.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The Charminar is a monument located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark
                    is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana.[3] The Charminar's
                    long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both
                    historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets
                    surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in
                    Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid
                    al-Fitr,[4] as it is adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.

                    The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi River.[5] To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and
                    to the southwest lies the richly ornamented granite Makkah Masjid.[6] It is listed as an
                    archaeological and architectural treasure on the official list of monuments prepared by the
                    Archaeological Survey of India.[7] The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu
                    words chār and minar or meenar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the eponymous towers are ornate
                    minarets attached and supported by four grand arches</p>
